This is actually a fork of DSpace used to develop a Learning Object repository
for the University of Warwick.
The modified DSpace is in the WARD-4_x branch.
A lot of code was borrowed from Jorum-DSpace for Content package ingestion, i.e. IMS/SCORM.
Unlike Jorum, Content package previews are generated dynamically from the manifests, whereas
Jorum generates static previews on ingestion.
Other enhancements include; collapsible asset lists to deal with the very long asset lists
from CP's, automatic generation of security groups, and assigning of users to groups, based
on information from Shibboleth headers.
